Please refer to <a href="http://axelrodgunnarson.blogspot.com/2013/10/transformers-mass-deobfuscation-of-php.html">My Blog</a> for details
In order to run this software, the following python libraries are needed:
    - sys
    - json
    - re
    - pexpect
    - os
    - collections
    - base64
    - tempfile
All of them should be already included in all versions of python 2.7
You will also need php software and the php evalhook extension (<a href="http://php-security.org/downloads/evalhook-0.1.tar.gz">Link to Download evalhook</a>)
